"READ ME for teensy synth." <br>
Slowly building and testing stuff on the teensy 4.0 w/ audio shield. <br>
Updates to the read me for v1.1 Thanks. <br>
<br>
To see audio layout (or make edits) go to https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/gui/?info=AudioOutputI2S# <br>
Click on the 'IMPORT' button at the top of the Audio Design tool page. <br>
Then open the setup.h file and copy paste all of that code into the import text entry window and click 'ok'. <br>
<br>
If adjustments are made to the audio flow, paste the changes back into the setup.h file using the 'export' button at the top of the page.<br>
